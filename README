Pre-populated variables:

 $? command exit status  global
 $_ command value        global
 $$ process ID           global
 $# argc                 per call
 $* argv                 per call
 $^ field separator      local
 $% job ID               per job
 $. current block        local

Scope:

 Variable names search the local scope first, and then up the tree of parent
 scopes. If a variable by that name is found in any scope along the way,
 that is the variable used for assignment or dereferencing. If no such variable
 was found, assignment then declares the variable in the local scope, and
 derefrencing is an error.

 Variables names prefixed with a dot act on local scope only. The dot is not
 part of the variable name.
